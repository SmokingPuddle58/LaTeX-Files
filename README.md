# LaTeX-Files

This is the LaTeX files for my notes and a template. PDF also included. Notes may be not completed.

To use the template, please note that both premeable.tex and template.tex need to be downloaded, and in general case, you do not need to edit premeable.tex, unless you wish to add your own functions, packages, and modify different color boxes, etc. You may directly type your document inside template.tex.
